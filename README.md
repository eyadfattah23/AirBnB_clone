# AirBnB_clone

## Project description:

This project is a clone of AirBnB web application built from scratch and will call it HBNB

### **first** start by building the console, Base class and methods, and a cmd

-- > the console is the entry point of the command interpreter

which will be used to manage our AirBnB objects

> This is the first step towards building our first full web application: **_"the AirBnB clone"_**. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this step with all other following steps: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

#### Each task/code is linked and will help us to:

> put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of our future instances.

> create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.

> create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel.

> create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.

> create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

## the command interpreter description:

### It's just like the shell but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

> Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

> Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

> Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

> Update attributes of an object

> Destroy an object

### To create a command interpreter in Python using the `cmd` module, you can follow these steps:

> 1. Import the necessary module:

```python
import cmd
```

> 2.  Create a class that inherits from `cmd.Cmd`:

```python
class MyCmd(cmd.Cmd):
    pass
```

> 3.  Override the `do_<command>` methods to define the commands you want to support:

```python
class MyCmd(cmd.Cmd):
    def do_greet(self, line):
        print("Hello!")

    def do_quit(self, line):
        return True
```

> 4.  Optionally, provide a prompt for the command interpreter:

```python
class MyCmd(cmd.Cmd):
    prompt = ">>> "

    def do_greet(self, line):
        print("Hello!")

    def do_quit(self, line):
        return True
```

> 5.  Create an instance of your command interpreter class and call the `cmdloop()` method to start the command loop:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    MyCmd().cmdloop()
```

Here's an example that puts all the steps together:

```python
import cmd

class MyCmd(cmd.Cmd):
    prompt = ">>> "

    def do_greet(self, line):
        print("Hello!")

    def do_quit(self, line):
        return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    MyCmd().cmdloop()
```

When you run this script, it will start the command interpreter and display the prompt ">>>". You can enter commands like "greet" or "quit" to interact with the command interpreter.
